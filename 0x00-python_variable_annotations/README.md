# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
Welcome to the 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations project! This directory contains exercises and tasks focused on variable annotations in Python. Variable annotations are a powerful feature that allows you to add type hints to your Python code, making it more readable and easier to debug.

## Learning Objectives
By completing the tasks in this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use variable annotations in Python.
- Annotate variables with appropriate types.
- Understand the benefits of using type hints.
- Improve code readability and maintainability with type hints.
## Project Structure
This directory contains the following files:

- 0-add.py: A function that takes two integers and returns their sum.
- 1-concat.py: A function that concatenates two strings.
- 2-floor.py: A function that returns the floor of a float.
- 3-to_str.py: A function that converts a float to a string.
- 4-define_variables.py: A script that defines and annotates several variables.
- 5-sum_list.py: A function that returns the sum of a list of floats.
- 6-sum_mixed_list.py: A function that returns the sum of a list of integers and floats.
- 7-to_kv.py: A function that takes a string and an int or float and returns a tuple.
- 8-make_multiplier.py: A function that returns a function that multiplies a float by a given multiplier.
- 9-element_length.py: A function that returns a list of tuples containing the length of each element in a list.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Knowledge of Python variable annotations
- Familiarity with basic Python concepts
## Usage
To use any of the functions provided in this directory, simply import them into your Python script and call them with the appropriate arguments. For example:

```pythone
from 0-add import add

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```
Each file contains a function with specific functionality. Refer to the docstrings within each file for more detailed information on usage.
